The only source code is main.py located in the source codes directory.
To run this code, open cmd and change to the source codes directory.
Then run the command: 'python main.py'

The python file has the following dependencies:
copy, random, time

If any of these are missing, run the command: pip install <dependency name>

The default output of the source code is running two test runs, one with
a word count of 10 and a line length of 20. The other with a word count of 100
and a line length of 50. The recursive function was not used due to its inefficiency.
