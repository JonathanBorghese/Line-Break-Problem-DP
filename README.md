# Line-Break-Problem-DP

This program tests three approaches to the line breaking problem
The first approach is a top down dynamic programmin approach
The second approach is a bottom up DP approach
Finally the last one is recursive


The only source code is main.py
The python file has the following dependencies:
copy, random, time

If any of these are missing, run the command: pip install <dependency name>

The default output of the source code is running two test runs, one with
a word count of 10 and a line length of 20. The other with a word count of 100
and a line length of 50. The recursive function was not used due to its inefficiency.
